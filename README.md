## README file designed that explains the steps required to run Selenium tests for a conversion calculator functionality. 

**Project Title:** 
Conversion Calculator Check

**Description:**
This repository contains Selenium tests to verify the functionality of the Conversion Calculator.

**Getting Started:**

Before running the tests, we need to set up your environment with the following prerequisites:
### Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed.

2. **Selenium**: You need to install the Selenium WebDriver. You can install it using pip:

<pip install selenium>

3. **WebDriver**: Download the WebDriver for your preferred browser. This project uses ChromeDriver by default. We can download it [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).
   Make sure to add the WebDriver executable to our system's PATH.

### Running the Tests

To run the Selenium tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/ragvi20/calculatorCheck_testcase.git

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

cd calculatorCheck-tests

3. Open the test script (`calculatorCheck_testcase.py`) and modify it according to specified requirements. * Update the URL and test scenarios if needed.

4. Execute the test script using the following command:

python calculatorCheck_testcase.py

The Selenium tests will launch a browser window, interact with the Conversion Calculator, and verify its functionality.

### Test Script Overview

- The test script interacts with the Conversion Calculator web page.
- It selects units to convert using dropdown lists.
- It enters a value and waits for the conversion to occur (no submit button required).
- The script checks the conversion result for correctness based on input value is valid or invalid.
